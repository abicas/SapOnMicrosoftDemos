Click on Test Connection to make sure the parameters are valid.   Alright, now we have the proper access to deploy a S/4HANA in your subscription.\nSAP CAL allows for a 30 day Trial of the Solutions available, where SAP licenses are waived for 30 days; only the cloud provider hosting fees apply. You can setup auto-shutdown and auto-terminate later on to make sure we keep costs low.\nIn order to deploy a Trial S/4HANA in you subscription:\n  Go to Solutions, pick the latest SAP S/4HANA Fully-Activated Appliance and click on Create Instance.   Select the newly created Account   Read and Accept the License terms of the Trial   Go to Advanced Mode so we can understand the parameters used on the deploy   Select your account.   Give your instance a name, description and validate the networking settings for the VNet. SAP will create a Default SAP CAL Network in case you have a new subscription. Select Public Static IP address so we can have remote access without the need for a VPN.   We won\u0026rsquo;t be deploying Business Objects so on the next step, you can desselect this VM. Later on you can change the VM types on azure to cheaper, smaller or newer ones. Scroll down and check all the parameters, ports, disk sizes so you can familiarize with the solution.   Provide a password for SAP Admin access that will be customized during the deployment. There will be local pre-defined users and admin users with this password. For more details see the Getting Started Guide for S/4HANA on SAP CAL with the default users and passwords.   Here we can adjust when the SAP will be available:\n By Schedule - Scheduled start and shutdown Suspend on an Exact Date - Scheduled to be running for XX number of days and then shutdown. Manual - If you do not plan to use it everyday. When you activate you can setup a shutdown time in hours in case you forget.  On the right side you can see the costs changing depending on the selection   Click Create on the bottom of the page, review the data and go grab lunch (it should take 2-3 hours for the deployment to be complete).   You can monitor the progress of the deployment in the Instances tab. Wait for Activated status.   When the solution is deployed and activated, click on the instance name and check the top menu, where you can control the SAP landscape (suspend/terminate/activate) as well as the remote desktop IP address used as Bastion Host for managing the environment on Azure. You can also access the Getting Started Guide under Solution Info tab as well make sure all the VMs are up and SAP was started properly and is communicating. All done ! You have an SAP S/4HANA running in your susbcription ! On the next section let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can access it and key users/passwords/parameters for conection that will be required later on.\n"

Add na For Each action and as parameter, STATUSINFO from Parse JSON previous action.  Inside the For Each loop add a Compose action. It will allow for us to pick desired fields for each line and build a JSON that suits our needs.  Build the desired JSON using the sample JSON below and replacing fields enclosed by \u0026lt;\u0026gt; using Dynamic Inputs as inputs (make sure you keep the commas) { \u0026quot;Order\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;DOC_NUMBER\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;DOC_DATE\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;Item\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;MATERIAL\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;Description\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;SHORT_TEXT\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;Quantity\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;REQ_QTY\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;Price\u0026quot;: \u0026lt;NET_PRICE\u0026gt; }   Inside the For Each loop, after Compose, add na action Append to array variable. Select outputArray previously initialized as empty and for Value Outputs from Compose action  Once For Each runs and populates outputArray with the desired data, we will convert it to an HTML table. Add a Create HTML table Action and use the outputArray as the data for the table.  Finally, we will add an action Send an email from Office 365 Outlook. You may need to connect Logic Apps with Office 365, by clicking on Change connection as did previously for SAP.  Let\u0026rsquo;s now build the email template that will be used on every invocation  To: Destination email Subject: Details for order  (replace with dynamic content) Body: as picture below    As the API response we will add a Response action and return  Status Code: 200 Body: JsonResponse from Dynamic inputs    Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to click SAVE !!!! ;)   If everything wen\u0026rsquo;t fine, we are ready to test the lab we just built, with NO CODE at all !\n"

	"content": "In this step we will execute the Workflow created previously\nGo back to Overview, Enable Debug mode (will be used in the future) and copy the Workflow URL provided We need to invoke the API, so we can use an externall tool like Postman or use the embeded Run Trigger tool.\nFor Postman:\n Method: POST URL: copied on the previous step Body: raw - JSON Body content: {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0000000728\u0026quot;} or {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0000001575\u0026quot;}  Note: SAP compares strings so have that in mind with leading zeroes and 10 total chars   Hit Send.   For Run Trigger tool:\n Click on Run Trigger with payload  Fill the request:  Method: POST Content-Type: application/json Body content: {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0000000728\u0026quot;} or {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0000001575\u0026quot;}  Note: SAP compares strings so have that in mind with leading zeroes and 10 total chars   Click Run    When your workflow runs, you should receive an Output status = 200  You can see the run status on the Run History tab  And by selecting the desired Run, you can see step-by-step inputs and outputs of your workflow for debug.  For a sucessful Run you can also see the details and the time it took on every step:   Now go check your email inbox because you should have something similar to the one below: If you need to check or compare a Sales Order on SAP, go to the Bastion Host via Remote Desktop, open SAP GUI and follow the steps below:\n Logon with BPINST/Welcome1  Go to TCODE VA03 (Display Sales Orders)\nSearch for the order number used on VA03\n Order: 728 or 1575 (here SAP compared numbers and don\u0026rsquo;t care about leading zeroes) Hit Search and you should see the details (to return to the previous screen, use the green arrow by the TCODE)   Congratulations ! You just finished the first lab and was able to create an API that will query SAP Sales Order and send an email, all with ZERO LINES of CODE !\n"
