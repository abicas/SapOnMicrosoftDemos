# SAP on Microsoft 
# labs


#### Welcome to the SAP on Microsoft Labs! 

This website is aimed to provide step-by-step guidance on how to integrate SAP systems with Microsoft services and software. 

We know that for an environment like SAP, having a robust infrastrcuture is a must-have, but with Microsoft you can do much more! 

This website is deivided in 3 main sections: 
- Environment Setup 
- SAP on Microsoft Labs 
- Environment Cleanup

Both sections can be accesses on the left menu and each one will be divided into smaller chunks of steps. 

Each lab can be run individually from each other and are divided into sub-sections: 
- Automation and Integration
- Data & AI 
- Security
- Infrastructure and Management 

On each lab introduction page, you will be presented by a demo video with the lab final result.

Some components used will depend on Trial licenses that expire after a given period of time. Before building up on top of those labs, make sure you do this in a properly licensed enviroment to avoid losing your work.

ATTENTION: Some VMs for SAP HANA used in this lab can become quite expensinve if you let it running. Make sure you define shutdown timers and in the end of your labs, go thru the Environment Cleanup section to remove unecessary resources

### Running the Labs

It is **strongly recommended** that you go thru Environment Setup before anything else, once the Labs assume the standards deployed in the previous section. 

Also for the labs themselves, **follow the steps in the order they were designed to** otherwise you risk having to startover from scratch.
