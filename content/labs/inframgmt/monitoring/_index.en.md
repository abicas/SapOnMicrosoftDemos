### Azure Monitoring for SAP

One of the benefits of monitoring SAP on Azure is the integrated view of both Infrastructure metrics (like CPU, RAM and Disk) alongside HANA database metrics (like memory usage and memory growth), and Netweaver metrics like concurrent sessions and locks. 

This allows for a rapid response in case of an incident response as well as provinding a simpler and more integrated way of having the whole SAP performance picture in a glance. 

This lab is based on the [Azure Monitor for SAP Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/azure-monitor-sap-quickstart) guide. 


### Estimated Time for this Lab

This lab is estimated to take between 20 and 30 minutes.
