The massive shift toward remote and hybrid work over the last two years has prompted many security professionals to reassess where siloed security may create vulnerabilities.For that reason, [Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) has become the gold standard for enterprise security. An effective Zero Trust approach requires comprehensive security—a holistic solution that covers all users, devices, and endpoints with central visibility. And any security solution you entrust with protecting your organization should be vetted by trusted industry sources.

There’s a reason Microsoft Security generated more than USD15 billion in revenue during 2021 with 45 percent growth. Microsoft is a Leader in four [Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ reports](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/security-leaders-gartner-magic-quadrant), eight [Forrester Wave™ reports](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-security-forrester-wave-leader), and six IDC MarketScape reports. As we head into another year marked by rapid change, Microsoft Security continues to deliver industry-leading protection across Zero Trust pillars, including identity, endpoints, applications, infrastructure, and data. 

#### Strengthen identity verification

Zero Trust security starts with strong identity verification. That means determining that only those people, devices, and processes you’ve authorized can access resources on your systems. As the cornerstone of Microsoft’s identity solutions, Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides a single identity control plane with common authentication and authorization for all your apps and services, even many non-Microsoft apps. Built-in conditional access in Azure AD lets you set policies to assess the risk levels for a user, device, sign-in location, or app. Admins can also make point-of-logon decisions and enforce access policies in real-time—blocking access, requiring a password reset, or granting access with an additional authentication factor.

#### Secure your network
Today’s modern architectures span on-premises systems, multiple cloud and hybrid services, VPNs, and more. Microsoft provides the scalable solutions needed to help secure any size network, including our cloud-native Microsoft Azure Firewall and Microsoft Azure DDoS Protection. Our XDR, security information and event management (SIEM), and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions—Microsoft 365 Defender and Microsoft Sentinel—empower your security operations centers (SOCs) to hunt for threats and easily coordinate your response from a single dashboard.

#### Limit access to your data
Limiting access to your data means upholding the three pillars of Zero Trust security—verify explicitly, apply least privileged access, and assume breach—across all files, wherever they reside. With Microsoft Information Protection, built-in labeling helps you maintain accurate classification, and machine learning-based trainable classifiers help deliver an exact data match. Microsoft Information Governance provides capabilities to govern your data for compliance or regulatory requirements, and Microsoft Data Loss Prevention empowers you to apply a consistent set of policies across the cloud, on-premises environments, and endpoints to monitor, prevent, and remediate risky activity.

#### The comprehensive coverage you need with Microsoft Security
Competing in today’s business environment means being able to move forward without constantly looking over your shoulder for the latest cyber threat. An effective Zero Trust architecture helps make that possible through a combination of comprehensive coverage, easy integration, built-in intelligence, and simplified management. Microsoft Security does all four—integrating more than 40 disparate products for security, compliance, identity, and management across clouds, platforms, endpoints, and devices—so you can move forward—fearless.
